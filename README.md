# SoraHub CS2 External Cheat :D 

Features : Team ESP / Web-Based Radar 

Web-Based Radar will work by having one person in the team use SoraHub and the user would send a link which will show a map of all the enemies, Essentially allowing the whole team have Radar Hacks without actually running a cheating software on their Host PC

Why make cheats? its a project for fun!
